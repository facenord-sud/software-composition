An other advantage is to provide smart autocompletion in almost every plateform

## Organization
All the files for the Scala library are under `src/main/scala`. The tests are not accuarte any more and will be updated soon.

In the package `examples` you can have a look at a simple code which generate and print the DICTŌ code to the console.
